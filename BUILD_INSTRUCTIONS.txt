  BATTERY MONITOR - Android App Build Instructions
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: This is a NATIVE ANDROID APP that cannot run in Replit.
You must export this code and build it in Android Studio.

================================================================================
  STEP 1: EXPORT FROM REPLIT
================================================================================

1. In Replit, click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Save the file to your computer
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., "BatteryMonitor")

================================================================================
  STEP 2: INSTALL ANDROID STUDIO
================================================================================

If you don't have Android Studio installed:

1. Go to: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Download Android Studio for your operating system
3. Run the installer
4. Follow the setup wizard to install:
   - Android SDK
   - Android SDK Platform
   - Android Virtual Device (for emulator)

================================================================================
  STEP 3: OPEN PROJECT IN ANDROID STUDIO
================================================================================

1. Launch Android Studio
2. On the welcome screen, click "Open"
   (Or go to File → Open if you already have a project open)
3. Navigate to the extracted "BatteryMonitor" folder
4. Click "OK"
5. Wait for Gradle sync to complete (this may take a few minutes)
6. If prompted to update Gradle or plugins, click "Update"

================================================================================
  STEP 4: CONNECT AN ANDROID DEVICE (OPTION A - RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

For best results, test on a real Android device:

1. On your Android device:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times to enable Developer Options
   - Go back to Settings → Developer Options (or System → Developer Options)
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. Connect your device to your computer via USB cable

3. On your device, tap "Allow" when prompted to authorize USB debugging

4. In Android Studio, you should see your device in the device dropdown
   at the top of the window

================================================================================
  STEP 5: OR USE AN EMULATOR (OPTION B)
================================================================================

If you don't have a physical device:

1. In Android Studio, click Tools → Device Manager
2. Click "Create Virtual Device"
3. Select a phone model (e.g., "Pixel 6") and click "Next"
4. Select a system image (e.g., "Tiramisu" - API 33) and click "Next"
   - If needed, click "Download" next to the system image first
5. Click "Finish"
6. Start the emulator by clicking the play button next to it

================================================================================
  STEP 6: BUILD AND RUN THE APP
================================================================================

1. In Android Studio, click the green "Run" button (▶) in the toolbar
   (Or press Shift+F10)

2. Select your connected device or running emulator from the list

3. Click "OK"

4. Wait for the build to complete (first build may take several minutes)

5. The app will automatically install and launch on your device/emulator

================================================================================
  STEP 7: ADD THE HOME SCREEN WIDGET
================================================================================

After the app is installed:

1. Long-press on an empty area of your home screen
2. Tap "Widgets" in the menu that appears
3. Scroll to find "Battery Monitor"
4. Long-press the widget and drag it to your home screen
5. Release to place it
6. Resize the widget by dragging the corners
7. The widget will start showing real-time battery data

================================================================================

================================================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: Gradle sync failed
Solution: 
  - Make sure you have internet connection
  - Click "Try Again" in the error message
  - Or go to File → Invalidate Caches and Restart

Problem: Device not showing in Android Studio
Solution:
  - Check USB debugging is enabled on your device
  - Try a different USB cable
  - Revoke and re-authorize USB debugging

Problem: App shows "0" for current and power
Solution:
  - This is normal on some devices/emulators
  - The Android API may not expose these values on all hardware
  - Try on a real Android device for accurate readings

Problem: Time estimates show "N/A"
Solution:
  - The app needs time to learn your usage patterns
  - Use the device normally for a few minutes
  - Charge or discharge the battery to provide data points

Problem: Widget not updating
Solution:
  - Remove and re-add the widget
  - Check battery optimization settings for the app
  - Restart your device

================================================================================
  BUILDING AN APK FILE
================================================================================

1. In Android Studio, go to Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
2. Wait for the build to complete
3. Click "locate" in the notification that appears
4. The APK will be at: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
5. Copy this file to your Android device and open it to install

For a release version:
